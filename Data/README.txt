All the datasources used in this research are enclosed in this GitHub repository.

Note that the enclosed data is generated and therefore anonymised, with only the top 1000 records to prevent huge file sizes.

In order to reproduce the research results, the provided datasets first need to be scaled to be equal to the sizes provided in the paper.
